  <h3 align="center">About me</h3>

- I'm a Software Engineer currently studying Computer Engineering at [Universidade Aberta](https://portal.uab.pt/).
- I worked at [ItaÃº Unibanco](https://www.itau.com.br/), the largest bank in Latin America, where I contributed to an AI-based serverless solution using AWS Lambda (Python), API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3 and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- I graduated from [42 School](https://42.fr/en/homepage/), where I gained strong experience in C, C++, Shell scripting, low-level programming (memory, processes, concurrency) and Docker.
- At 42, I also had introductory experience with backend development using Node.js, TypeScript, Fastify, SQLite and microservices architecture.
- I completed the AWS re/Start program by Amazon Web Services, gaining knowledge in Linux, Python, networking, security, automation and core AWS Cloud skills.
- I passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam and received the certification.
- I learned Arduino and basic web development (HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL) at TecPuc.

  <h3 align="center">Now some random stuff</h3>
  
- If I could choose a character to describe my personality I would choose Andrea Sachs from *The Devil Wears Prada*!
- I was once called on stage by Pharrell Williams at a concert... and I said no.
- I'm surprisingly good at winning contests. I've won free dinners, festival tickets, cinema passes, cash prizes and even a Nintendo Switch.
- I need to read at least 10 pages of a book before bed or I can't fall asleep (currently reading *A Clash of Kings*).
- I have a background in classical dance and taught ballet classes for several years.
- I'm autistic (Level 1).
- I'm obsessed with sports in general, but I prefer cheering and watching over actually playing.
- People often find me hard to label. I donâ€™t really match the idea most have of a developer, or a dancer, or even an autistic person. Iâ€™ve learned to enjoy that ðŸ˜Š.
- I love hearing random facts about people. Share yours with me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claralfranco/), [Email](mailto:claralimafranco@gmail.com)
